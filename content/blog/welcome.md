We're excited to share updates, tips, and deep dives on **TOON format** and how it can cut your LLM API costs.

## Why TOON?

Standard JSON is verbose. Every key needs quotes, colons, and commas—which adds up when you're sending thousands of requests. TOON strips that down:

- **Fewer tokens** — Typically 30–50% reduction
- **Same structure** — Nested objects and arrays supported
- **Easy to adopt** — Use our free converter or integrate the format in your pipeline

## What to expect

In this blog we'll cover:

1. **Format guides** — Syntax and edge cases
2. **Integration tips** — Using TOON with popular LLM APIs
3. **Benchmarks** — Real-world token and cost comparisons
4. **Changelog** — New features and improvements

Thanks for reading. Try the [converter](/en#converter) and see your savings.
