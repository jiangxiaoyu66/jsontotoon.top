    "q1": {
      "question": "What is JSON to TOON and TOON to JSON?",
      "answer": "JSON to TOON converts standard JSON to TOON format, while TOON to JSON converts it back. Both conversions are designed for LLM token reduction, helping you reduce API costs by 30-50% when working with ChatGPT, Claude, or OpenAI."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How to reduce LLM token usage?",
      "answer": "Use our JSON to TOON converter to minimize token consumption by 30-50%. TOON format removes unnecessary characters while preserving data structure, making it ideal for LLM API cost optimization."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Can I convert TOON to JSON?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our TOON to JSON converter lets you convert TOON back to standard JSON format instantly. The conversion is lossless - all your data structure and values are preserved perfectly."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How much can I save on LLM API costs?",
      "answer": "Typically 30-50% fewer tokens compared to standard JSON. Use the JSON to TOON converter to see exact savings for your payloads. This translates to significant cost reduction for OpenAI, ChatGPT, and Claude APIs."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How to optimize JSON for LLM?",
      "answer": "Use JSON to TOON conversion. Our converter automatically removes redundant characters, minimizes whitespace, and creates token-efficient representations perfect for LLM applications."
